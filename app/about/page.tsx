          Founded under the Office of the CEO at SHV Groups, Lokakṣema emerged from one conviction:
          artificial intelligence must serve humanity&apos;s welfare.

        <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold">Why Lokakṣema?</h2>
        <div className="space-y-4 text-neutral-200">
          <p>
            The name &quot;Lokakṣema&quot; derives from Sanskrit, meaning &quot;welfare of the world.&quot; It embodies our
            commitment to ensuring emerging technologies advance equity, justice, and sustainable prosperity across all nations,
            not just the privileged few.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional AI conferences focus on technical competition or commercial advantage. Lokakṣema anchors AI within
            the broader arc of human well-being, ethical governance, and global equity.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recognize that AI&apos;s transformative potential spans healthcare, climate adaptation, agriculture, financial inclusion,
            education, and public governance. But we also acknowledge the challenges: fairness, accountability, safety, and
            intensifying geopolitical competition.
          </p>
          <p>Lokakṣema 2026 is our response to these dualities.</p>
