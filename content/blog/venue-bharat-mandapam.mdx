The choice of **Bharat Mandapam** signals our intent to convene a **truly global** audience in a space engineered for **accessibility**, **broadcast**, and **security**.

- Full accessibility provisions (wheelchair access, assistive services)  
- Proximity to metro and international airport  

Itâ€™s where logistics empower ideas to scale.
