**Lokakṣema 2026** is a global initiative focused on ensuring that artificial intelligence serves the **welfare of all**.

Hosted at **Bharat Mandapam, Pragati Maidan, New Delhi**, the summit combines high-level plenaries with deep-dive tracks in **Technical & Research**, **Business Strategy & Investment**, and **Policy, Ethics & Society**.

### Why now?

AI is at an inflection point. We’re aligning state capacity, private-sector execution, and academic rigor to deliver **measurable impact**—from healthcare equity to climate resilience.

### Chairman's Message

What began as a small idea rooted in responsibility towards humanity has now grown into something far bigger than I could have imagined.

When I first explored AI, I thought: “Woah, this is so cool.” But as I went deeper into research, I realized it’s not just “cool”. it’s one of the greatest powers humanity will ever hold. And like every great power, it depends on how we use it.

AI, like nuclear energy, has two sides: immense potential and serious risks. If we only fear the risks, we’ll never unlock the potential. If we ignore the risks, we’ll harm ourselves. The answer lies in balance.

At SHV GROUPS, we’ve chosen not to follow the crowd blindly. Instead, we’re building advanced AI with responsibility, safety, and the well-being of humanity at its core.

Lokākṣema 2026 is our step towards that vision, a global summit dedicated to responsible AI for humanity’s future.

I welcome you to join us on this journey. Together, let’s shape a future where AI is not just powerful, but profoundly human.

### What to expect

- **10,000+ participants** and delegations from **30+ countries**
- A **global hackathon** producing reproducible open-source artifacts
- Multi-stakeholder dialogues culminating in the **New Delhi Accord on Responsible AI**
